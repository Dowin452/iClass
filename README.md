About : Iclass

iClass is a simple terminal based text editor that supports C , Python and ASM Syntax highlighting.
There are two versions of iClass. C version and Python version that their source codes are available.
You can install iClass via github in your linux terminal (it's less than 50kb)
iClass is vim based and has command mode and insert mode like vim. But the commands are less than vim and it's good for those people who want to learn vim.
For c version you have to install ncurses and gcc and compile so it's hard. (But faster)
For python version you have to just install python3 and curses if you don't have it

iClass v1.0.1
